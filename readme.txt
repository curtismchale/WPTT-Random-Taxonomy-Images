Allows a user to set a header image for a WordPress category. If no image is set for a term the plugin will look inside your theme
for a folder called 'random' and get a random .jpg image to show as the header image.

== Installation ==

1. Extract wptt-random-taxonomy-images/ to your wp-content/plugins/
folder.

2. Activate the plugin.

== Usage ==

Decide what the dimensions of your category images are. Crop them, then upload them to the WordPress media gallery.

Copy and paste the image paths to the categories you want them on.

Put the images you want as 'random' options in a folder called 'random' in your theme. All random images must be .jpg
